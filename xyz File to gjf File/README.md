'.xyz' files are simple text-based files that represent the atomic coordinates for a molecule. Programs that output '.xyz' files are those involved in exploring molecular modeling such as CREST.(Conformer-Rotamer Ensemble Sampling Tool).

'.gjf' files are used to run quantum chemistry calculations on Gaussian software
